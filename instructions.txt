I want to create an app that allows me to create a "Spotting Board"

An example of the final result of this spotting board is the file in this directory called michigan_state_spotting_board.pdf.

Spotting Board definition:
I need to make an offensive and defensive player spotting board. I want it to be in boxes - 10 x 10 with name and number for each player in a box. So #0 is always in the upper left hand corner and 99 would always be in lower right. I want each box to formatted with number centered and then a dash and then the players position, so like 55 - LB ... now since this is college football there may be double numbers, so that we could have a 13 - WR and a 13 - DB in the same box. Offensive players should be in the top 50% of the square and defense lower 50%... so if there is only one #13 if he's on offense then the bottom of the squre is empty. The Offensive (top of square) names should be in a green box and the defensive (bottom of square) names should be in a red box.

To help create the spotting board, I want a form submit type page that allows me to put in some information that will be used for the spotting board. Upon submission, you will create the spotting board using the information provided in the form.

The form should have the following fields:
- Team Name
- A json input with the following fields:

{
    "players": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "position": "QB",
            "name": "John Doe"
            "phonetic_name": "John Doe"
        }
    ]
}

The json input will be used to create the spotting board.
