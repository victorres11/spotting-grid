## Usage

### 1. **Select Your Team**
- Choose from the dropdown of Big Ten Conference teams
- Each team includes official branding and colors

### 2. **Input Player Data**
- Paste your roster JSON data in the provided field
- Format: `{"players": [{"number": 1, "position": "QB", "name": "John Doe", "phonetic_name": "JOHN DOE"}]}`

#### **Manual Position Override (Flip System)**
You can manually override a player's automatic categorization by adding a `"flip"` property:
- **Normal**: Player appears on offense/defense based on their position
- **Flipped**: Add `"flip": "y"` to put the player on the opposite side

**Examples:**
```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "position": "QB",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "phonetic_name": "JOHN DOE"
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "position": "CB",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "phonetic_name": "JANE SMITH",
      "flip": "y"
    }
  ]
}
```
In this example:
- Player #1 (QB) appears on offense (green) - normal behavior
- Player #2 (CB) appears on offense (green) instead of defense (red) - flipped!

### 3. **Generate Board**
- Click "Generate Board" to create your spotting board
- The application automatically organizes players by position and number

### 4. **Print or Save**
- Use the "Print/Save as PDF" button
- Optimized for both printing and digital sharing

### **Font Sizing Algorithm**
The application uses intelligent font sizing to maximize readability:
- **Base Size**: 12px for optimal visibility
